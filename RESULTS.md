### 🔍 Key Observations

**Algorithm Performance:**

- Match scores ranging from **47.5% to 53.4%** indicate moderate to good cosine similarity alignment
- Higher "Yes" answer rates (90-95%) correlate with higher match scores, suggesting the algorithm rewards engagement
- The cosine similarity with rarity weighting successfully differentiates between persona types

**Category Matching Accuracy:**

- **Tech Enthusiast:** Excellent matches with technology, business, and professional development clubs
- **Artist & Creator:** Strong alignment with arts, creative, and wellness-focused organizations
- **Advocate / Volunteer:** Perfect matches with service-oriented and community engagement clubs
- **Health & Sports:** Partial accuracy—wellness clubs matched well, but sports clubs showed some category bleed
- **Academic Researcher:** Outstanding balance across academic, professional, and technical domains

**Areas for Improvement:**

- **Health/Sports overlap:** The fourth persona showed category bleed between health and sports clubs, suggesting tag refinement could improve specificity
- **Score distribution:** Match scores cluster in the 45-55% range, indicating the algorithm could benefit from increased differentiation
- **Rarity weighting impact:** Less common interests appear to receive appropriate weighting, as specialized clubs (e.g., "Fiber Arts Club") rank highly for relevant personas

### ✨ Conclusion

The CampusCompass quiz matching system demonstrates **strong overall performance** with 4 out of 5 personas receiving highly accurate recommendations. The cosine similarity algorithm with rarity weighting and L2 normalization effectively clusters clubs based on user interests. The primary area for enhancement involves refining category tags to reduce overlap between related but distinct interest areas, particularly in the Health & Wellness and Sports & Recreation domains.

**Recommendation:** The system is ready for deployment with minor tag refinements to improve specificity in overlapping categories.
